== py2php ==

py2php is a utility that will translate ("port") one python file into PHP.

It is intended as a porting aid only.  You will still need to review the generated
PHP and make some tweaks.   But it does handle a lot of the grunt work and common cases.

py2php is just a heavily modified copy of pyjs.py from the pyjamas project.  pyjs.py
was written to translate python to javascript.  py2php simply changes the output
semantics from JS to php.

== translate_python_to_php ==

translate_python_to_php is a wrapper script for py2php.  Run it in any directory
without arguments and it will attempt to translate all the .py files into .php files.

Run it with one or more arguments, and it will attempt to translate the files in
the argument list.

== Porting Convention ==

When porting python code, I have been manually creating a subdirectory
named _autotranslated, into which I move all the original .py files.  I
then run translate_python_to_php which creates all the translated .php files.
I then copy (not move!) those generated files back into the parent directory
for review and tweaking, to finish the port.

This way, the _autotranslated directory contains only original .py files
and the autogenerated .php files.  This should make things easier in the
future when the upstream python project releases a new version.  Then we
will simply copy the new .py files into a new tmp directory, re-run the
autotranslater, and then we have a nice PHP <--> PHP diff we can use as
a porting aid.  Once the port is complete, the tmp directory files should
replace the contents of _autotranslated directory.
